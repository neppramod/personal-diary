It is a personal note taking application. It keeps our texts safe and later, we can search the text on any date. It lets browse our entry, edit them. User can browse recent entries from the home page, or go to list page to list out the entries. Currently it has very basic features like adding entries(no special formatting), searching, list with pagination(contextual based on date of entry). Still there might be inconsistencies with different pages and I did not try things like sitemesh or tiles to give a theme. It can be used as a starting spring, hibernate project on this topic. So Enjoy.
